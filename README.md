# Virtual Painter

This project is about using openCV and mediapipe libraries to utilize the webcamera for drawing in real time.
The main idea is:

*Detect hands using mediapipe.
*Detect wheither the index and middle fingers are up.
*Detect fingers' tip location.
*Draw a line when only the index finger is up and make a sellection when both index and middle fingers are up.
*Draw on a black canvas then mask it with actual frame.
